# Wastewater-Heat-Recovery-Models
This repository contains the different models developed for evaluating heat recovery from wastewater. The models are developed as a part of the FORMAS funded project HÅVA (Sustainable heat recovery from wastewater). The models are developed by [Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/) and [RISE](https://www.ri.se/en). 

Models for different components of the urban wastewater system are developed.

<strong>1. Wastewater generation model</strong>  
This model generates flow rate, pollutant concentration and temperature values for households. Add more desc.

The models are described in the following papers

<strong>2. Sewer heat transfer model</strong>  
This model describes the major heat transfer processes in sewer systems (both gravity sewers and rising mains). Both temperature and flow rate variations can be described using the model.
